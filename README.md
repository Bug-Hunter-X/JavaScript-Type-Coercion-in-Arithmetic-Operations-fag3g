# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion in arithmetic operations.  JavaScript's dynamic typing can cause unexpected behavior when numbers and strings are mixed in mathematical expressions.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix the issue by ensuring that operands are of the correct type before performing the calculation.
